# Fantasy-Football-Statistics-Research-Project
This project investigates if a programmed decision model - which decides the best optimized fantasy lineup based on multiple factors such as coaching and statistics - can create a better performing team than one decided by the predetermined algorithm in fantasy football apps such as ESPN for a PPR fantasy football league. The goal for this project is to create an algorithm using Java as the programming language that uses previous season statistics, matchup and coaching data, and other advanced factors. This project overall looks to see if other external variables improve the accuracy of a fantasy lineup algorithm. This repository will contain data from the 2022 to 2024 NFL seasons, research notes, visual graphs, weekly results, and a final research summary. 

Research Question: Can a hyrbid model that analyzes external factors as well as player projections outperform a standard projection model in creating a higher performing fantasy football team?
